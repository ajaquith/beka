                <p><span class="dropcaps">O</span>rganizations that tackle inequity,
                    create opportunity and inspire creativity make up the fabric
                    of cohesive, vibrant communities.</p>
                <p>To survive and thrive in today&rsquo;s fluid environment, mission-based
                    organizations must build the knowledge, tools and capacities to
                    support continuous adaptation. Ask yourself:</p>                    
                <ul>
                    <li>How will you respond to the evolving needs of
                    your constituents and communities?</li>
                    <li>Are you ready to embark on a period of change?</li>
                    <li>Have you considered the business implications of your program
                        plans?</li>
                    <li>Do your mission, strategy and financial story align in your
                        case for support?</li>

                <p>RTA offers a continuum of customized training and consulting

                    of connecting money to strategy, and strategy to mission. 
                    Philanthropic leaders are called upon to re-imagine how they structure
                    and deploy investments. Nonprofit leaders must re-conceive of
                    how they raise and manage limited resources to increase their
                    organizations&rsquo; effectiveness. Key questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are your resources aligned to support the outcomes you
                        seek?</li>
                    <li>Is your staff equipped to assess readiness for organizational
                        change and risk-taking?</li>
                    <li>Are you effectively communicating the impact of your
                        investments?</li>

                <p>RTA brings strategic advice and hands-on support to help your
                    foundation strengthen the alignment of money and mission.</p>

                            and adaptable organizations. Offered by Grantmakers in the
                            Arts (GIA), the workshop develops a common vocabulary about
                            capitalization and the relationship between financial health
                            and creative freedom. Each discussion is grounded in the
                            realities of the local eco-system and reveals how funders
                            can change their policies and practice to have more candid
                            discussions about finances with their constituents.</div>

                        another for a local community foundation. Among the questions the
                        evaluations seek to answer are: Did grantees improve their
                        financial health as a result of our investment? Did their business
                        models become more reliable? How are they using knowledge about
                        capitalization to improve management practices and fundraising
                        outcomes? These projects involve developing recommendations for
                        how future, similar grant programs can strategically invest in
                        capitalization as a means to mission success.</div>
