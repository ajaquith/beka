                <p><span class="dropcaps">O</span>rganizations that tackle inequity,
                    create opportunity and inspire creativity make up the fabric
                    of cohesive, vibrant and just communities.</p>
                <p>To survive and thrive in today’s fluid environment, mission-based
                    organizations must build the knowledge, tools and capacities to
                    support continuous adaptation. Ask yourself:</p>                    
                <ul>
                    <li>What resources are needed to respond to the evolving needs of
                    your constituents and communities?</li>
                    <li>Are you ready to embark on a period of change?</li>
                    <li>Have you considered the business implications of your program
                        plans?</li>
                    <li>Do your mission, strategy and financial story align in your
                        case for support?</li>

                <p>RTA offers a continuum of customized training and consulting
                    services to help your organization adapt in ways that contribute

                <p><span class="dropcaps">N</span>avigating change requires new ways
                    of connecting money to strategy, and strategy to mission. It
                    demands that philanthropic leaders re-imagine how they structure
                    and deploy investments and that nonprofit leaders re-conceive of
                    how they raise and manage limited resources to increase their
                    organizations’ effectiveness. Key questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are your resources aligned to support the outcomes you
                        seek?</li>
                    <li>Is your staff equipped to assess readiness for organizational
                        change and risk-taking?</li>
                    <li>Are you effectively communicating the impact of your
                        investments?</li>

                <p>RTA brings strategic advice and hands-on support to help your

                            and creative freedom. Each discussion is grounded in the
                            realities of the local eco-system and reveals how funders
                            can change their policies and practice to have more candid
                            discussions about finances with their constituents.</div>

                        evaluation seeks to answer are: Did grantees improve their
                        financial health as a result of our investment? Did their
                        business models become more reliable? How are they using
                        knowledge about capitalization to improve management practices
                        and fundraising outcomes? This project involves developing
                        recommendations for how future, similar grant programs can
                        strategically invest in capitalization as a means to mission
                        success.</div>
